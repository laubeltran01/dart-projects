# Calculator

Write a calculator that performs the four basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Substraction
- Multiplication
- Division

For example,

```dart
calculator.add(2, 5) === 7;
calculator.subtract(5, 3) === 2;
calculator.multiply(5, 6) === 30;
calculator.divide(12, 4) === 3;
```

## Bonus
Add the _exponential_ function to the calculator. For example
```dart
calculator.expontentiate(2, 6) === 32
```

## Recommended Practices
- Use types
- Use classes
- Documentation
- Add unit testing
